# Project Name
Lead conversion prediction in a mobile app company

## Project Intro/Objective
Lead conversion is a crucial aspect of business, especially for app and website companies. Identifying and predicting which leads are likely to become paying customers is important, since those individuals contribute a lot to the company's profit margin. A lead conversion rate of around 11% is deemed to be a good percentage, so every compny wants to achieve that and even more, and the best way to do that is to predict these, so that the required and appropriate arrangements are made to enable them complete the process of converting, to keep making profits for the company and business 

### Methods Used
* Data exploration/descriptive statistics

* Streamlit for frontend
* Docker for containerization
* Weights and biases for experiment tracking
* Fast API for backend
* Visual studio code, jupyter
* Git
* Unit Testing(pytest)
* Github actions for CI/CD

## Project Description
#### The ability to predict leads that are likely to convert is crucial to this company, so they know which people to target wehn they first hear about their app. For a lead to convert, there are various processes, the ideal process is,lead hears about app, leads checks out app, leads reads more about the app elsewhere, leads registers with the app, hence lead converts. During this process, the lead can stop at anytime, so its important to be able to predict the ones that are likley to convert to enable them complete the converting process succesfully. I obtained the dataset from a practise test i was given, and i synthesized the dataset so it doesnt look too much like the original.
### The questions i deemed to explore were:
#### What are the characteristics of leads that converted, is there a trend in their behaviour online?
#### Can i predict with a reasonable amount of certainty the leads that are likely to convert, since 11% is the best percentage of leads that actually convert?
#### Whats the best way to get this app to the company so they use to improve their business?

#### Some of the challenges faced were:
#### Only a little under 5% of leads converted with this app, so best way to balance the data appropriately so the ML algorithm trains on it without bias
#### Which model to use that gives high performance, and also explainability

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. For users, go to https://share.streamlit.io/joamps/lead_conversion_prediction_for_a_mobile_app_company/main/frontend-streamlit/streamlit_app.py to test the app out

## Results
The first and important thing was to look at the characteristics of leads that converted,
